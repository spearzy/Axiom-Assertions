# Axiom vs Shouldly

Axiom Assertions and Shouldly both try to make test intent easier to read than raw framework assertions. They differ more in style and priorities than in raw capability headlines.

Axiom is newer and narrower. Shouldly is older and far more established. The useful question is which style and trade-off set fits the codebase you have.

## What Axiom Currently Emphasizes

Axiom is worth evaluating when you want:

- deterministic failure messages with a predictable structure
- explicit grouped failures with `Batch`
- a clearer separation between the main assertion package, analyzers, and optional JSON and vector support
- stronger emphasis on equivalency configuration and retrieval-oriented assertions

```csharp
using Axiom.Assertions;
using Axiom.Core;

var actualStatus = "Queued";

using var batch = Assert.Batch("status");
actualStatus.Should().Be("Queued");
actualStatus.Should().StartWith("Que");
```

## What Shouldly Still Offers Today

Shouldly remains the safer choice when you want:

- a very natural-language assertion style
- a team that already prefers the Shouldly idioms and message style
- a lighter migration path from an existing Shouldly-heavy test suite

If your main reason for choosing a library is that the assertion syntax should read almost like prose, Shouldly may still be the better match.

## Style Trade-Offs

Axiom tends to prefer explicit method names and stable output over a more conversational tone. Shouldly leans harder into the conversational style.

Neither approach is inherently right. The important thing is which one helps your team maintain tests without ambiguity.

## A Practical Rule Of Thumb

Evaluate Axiom when deterministic messages, explicit batching, analyzers, equivalency, optional JSON assertions, or optional AI and retrieval assertions solve a real problem for the team.

Stay with Shouldly when the natural-language assertion style is the main reason for the choice and that style is already serving the team well.
