# Migrating to Axiom

This page is for teams moving an existing test suite onto Axiom in stages.

The built-in migration analyzers help with a growing set of safe, mechanical rewrites. Structural assertions still need engineering judgment. That is normal. This guide tries to make that judgment simpler.

## What Can Be Migrated Automatically Today

The current analyzer and code-fix wave focuses on high-confidence xUnit `Assert.*` shapes.

| Source style | Axiom style |
| --- | --- |
| `Assert.Equal(expected, actual)` | `actual.Should().Be(expected)` |
| `Assert.NotEqual(expected, actual)` | `actual.Should().NotBe(expected)` |
| `Assert.Null(value)` | `value.Should().BeNull()` |
| `Assert.NotNull(value)` | `value.Should().NotBeNull()` |
| `Assert.True(condition)` | `condition.Should().BeTrue()` |
| `Assert.False(condition)` | `condition.Should().BeFalse()` |
| `Assert.Empty(subject)` | `subject.Should().BeEmpty()` |
| `Assert.NotEmpty(subject)` | `subject.Should().NotBeEmpty()` |
| `Assert.Contains(item, collection)` | `collection.Should().Contain(item)` |
| `Assert.DoesNotContain(item, collection)` | `collection.Should().NotContain(item)` |
| `Assert.Contains(expectedSubstring, actualString)` | `actualString.Should().Contain(expectedSubstring)` |
| `Assert.DoesNotContain(expectedSubstring, actualString)` | `actualString.Should().NotContain(expectedSubstring)` |
| `Assert.Contains(key, dictionary)` | `dictionary.Should().ContainKey(key)` or `.WhoseValue` when you use the associated value |
| `Assert.DoesNotContain(key, dictionary)` | `dictionary.Should().NotContainKey(key)` |
| `Assert.Single(subject)` | `subject.Should().ContainSingle()` or `.SingleItem` when you use the item |
| `Assert.Single(subject, predicate)` | `subject.Should().ContainSingle(predicate)` or `.SingleItem` when you use the matched item |
| `Assert.Same(expected, actual)` | `actual.Should().BeSameAs(expected)` |
| `Assert.NotSame(expected, actual)` | `actual.Should().NotBeSameAs(expected)` |
| `Assert.IsType<T>(actual)` | `actual.Should().BeOfType<T>()` |
| `Assert.IsAssignableFrom<T>(actual)` | `actual.Should().BeAssignableTo<T>()` |
| `Assert.Throws<TException>(() => work())` | `new Action(() => work()).Should().Throw<TException>()` |

For dictionary-key migration, the receiver has to fit Axiom's `ContainKey` / `NotContainKey` surface. The current support covers `IDictionary<TKey, TValue>`, `IReadOnlyDictionary<TKey, TValue>`, `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`, `ReadOnlyDictionary<TKey, TValue>`, `ConcurrentDictionary<TKey, TValue>`, and `ImmutableDictionary<TKey, TValue>`.

These suggestions ship in:

- `Axiom.Assertions` by default
- `Axiom.Analyzers` if you only want the diagnostics

## What Still Needs Manual Migration

The migration tooling is conservative on purpose.

It skips cases where the rewrite is not obviously semantics-preserving yet, including:

- overloads with custom comparers, precision, inspectors, or messages
- nongeneric `Assert.Single(subject)` when you use the returned value
- `Assert.Throws<TException>(...)` when you use the returned exception
- most structural-comparison assertions

If a code fix appears, it is meant to be a safe one. If it does not appear, treat the migration as a normal test rewrite rather than a missed trick.

## Choosing Between Scalar And Structural Migration

A simple rule helps here.

If the original test is checking one fact at a time, migrate it to scalar Axiom assertions.

```csharp
actual.Name.Should().Be("Ada");
actual.Email.Should().Contain("@");
```

If the original test is really comparing one object graph with another, move it to `BeEquivalentTo(...)` instead of rewriting it into many scalar assertions.

```csharp
actual.Should().BeEquivalentTo(expected);
```

That keeps the test aligned with the shape of the behavior you actually care about.

## Migrating Structural Assertions

### Simple Object-Graph Comparison

If the original assertion is conceptually "these two objects should match member-for-member", start here:

```csharp
actual.Should().BeEquivalentTo(expected);
```

Do this before adding options. The defaults are strict and easy to reason about.

### Cross-Type Comparison

If the types differ but they represent the same concept and the member names already line up, disable strict runtime type matching:

```csharp
actual.Should().BeEquivalentTo(expected, options =>
    options.RequireStrictRuntimeTypes = false);
```

That is the normal Axiom target for DTO-to-domain or snapshot-to-response comparisons when the shapes are mostly the same.

### Renamed Members

If the shapes are the same but some member names changed, add only the mappings you need.

```csharp
actual.Should().BeEquivalentTo(expected, options =>
{
    options.RequireStrictRuntimeTypes = false;
    options.MatchMember<ActualUser, ExpectedUser>(x => x.GivenName, x => x.FirstName);
    options.MatchMember<ActualUser, ExpectedUser>(x => x.Address.Postcode, x => x.Location.ZipCode);
});
```

Use typed mappings when you can. They are easier to read and safer to refactor.

If the mapping has to come from strings, use `MatchMemberName(...)` instead.

### Custom Comparers, Ordering, And Tolerances

If the original test used domain-specific comparison rules, carry those rules over directly instead of flattening the test.

Examples:

```csharp
actual.Should().BeEquivalentTo(expected, options =>
    options.CollectionOrder = EquivalencyCollectionOrder.Any);

actual.Should().BeEquivalentTo(expected, options =>
    options.DateTimeTolerance = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1));

actual.Should().BeEquivalentTo(expected, options =>
    options.UseComparer<OrderSnapshot>(x => x.Code, StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase));
```

This is usually the right migration shape when the structural comparison is still the core idea and only a few comparison rules need to change.

## When Manual Migration Is Better

Some structural assertions should stay manual even if they look close to a possible automation target.

Keep the migration manual when:

- the original assertion mixes many domain-specific comparison rules
- the original test intentionally compares only a small stable subset of the graph
- the original assertion relies on custom comparers or tolerances that need review
- the original test is easier to understand as a few scalar assertions than as a broad graph comparison
- the structural comparison has unclear semantics and needs a test-design decision, not a syntax rewrite

That last point matters. A manual migration is often the right move when the old test itself was not very explicit.

## Example: Rewriting A Structural Test

Before:

```csharp
Assert.Equal(expected.Name, actual.Name);
Assert.Equal(expected.Email, actual.Email);
Assert.Equal(expected.Address.Postcode, actual.Address.Postcode);
Assert.Equal(expected.Address.CountryCode, actual.Address.CountryCode);
```

After:

```csharp
actual.Should().BeEquivalentTo(expected);
```

If one member was renamed:

```csharp
actual.Should().BeEquivalentTo(expected, options =>
{
    options.RequireStrictRuntimeTypes = false;
    options.MatchMember<ActualUser, ExpectedUser>(x => x.GivenName, x => x.FirstName);
});
```

If order does not matter for one collection:

```csharp
actual.Should().BeEquivalentTo(expected, options =>
    options.CollectionOrder = EquivalencyCollectionOrder.Any);
```

## Recommended Migration Flow

For most teams, the smoothest sequence is:

1. Install `Axiom.Assertions`.
2. Apply the obvious analyzer-driven rewrites first.
3. Move structural comparisons to `BeEquivalentTo(...)` manually.
4. Add only the minimum equivalency options needed for that test.
5. Keep unclear or overloaded cases manual until the intended semantics are explicit.

That keeps the migration trustworthy.
